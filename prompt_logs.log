LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him.

Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the "forgotten floor," where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the "forgotten floor." Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually "avoidable felonies." He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' » . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. "I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered "lunatics" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the "forgotten floor"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served. E-mail to a friend .

In the heart of Miami, a stark reality unfolds on the ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility, a place ominously referred to as the "forgotten floor." This is where some of the most vulnerable members of our society—individuals grappling with severe mental illnesses—are confined, often awaiting trial for charges that, according to Judge Steven Leifman, could frequently be avoided. The grim conditions of this floor highlight a systemic failure that not only neglects the needs of these individuals but also perpetuates a cycle of injustice.

As we step into this environment, the first thing that strikes you is the disorienting atmosphere. The inmates, clad in sleeveless robes designed to prevent self-harm, appear almost ghost-like, their humanity obscured by the harsh realities of their confinement. The absence of basic comforts—shoes, laces, and mattresses—further emphasizes their plight. Here, one-third of the inmates are mentally ill, a staggering statistic that underscores the overwhelming burden on the system. The cacophony of voices, some rational, others lost in delusion, fills the air. One inmate, convinced of his connection to power, shouts, "I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!" His fervent belief in his own narrative is a poignant reminder of the depths of his illness.

Judge Leifman, a passionate advocate for reform, guides us through this harrowing landscape. He explains that many of these individuals find themselves in this predicament not because of their actions alone, but due to confrontations with law enforcement that escalate when mentally ill individuals are unable to comply with commands. This often leads to arrests for avoidable felonies, a tragic outcome of a system ill-equipped to handle mental health crises.

Historically, the treatment of the mentally ill has oscillated between neglect and mistreatment. Two centuries ago, individuals deemed "lunatics" were locked away without charges, simply because they were considered unfit for society. While there was a movement to transition these individuals from jails to hospitals, many of those facilities were so inhumane that they were ultimately shut down. The result? A significant number of mentally ill individuals found themselves homeless, wandering the streets without the treatment they desperately needed.

Today, the numbers tell a sobering story. In 1955, over half a million people were housed in state mental hospitals; today, that number has plummeted by 90%. With only 40,000 to 50,000 individuals receiving care in mental hospitals, the gap in treatment is glaring. Judge Leifman is determined to change this narrative. Since 2008, he has championed the establishment of a new mental health facility aimed at providing long-term treatment rather than mere punishment. This initiative represents a crucial first step toward addressing the needs of these individuals and breaking the cycle of recidivism.

The implications of this shift are profound. By redirecting mentally ill inmates to appropriate care, we not only provide them with the help they need but also alleviate the burden on families and save the state money. It’s a win-win solution that embodies the essence of justice—one that recognizes the humanity of those who have been marginalized and forgotten.

As we reflect on our visit to the "forgotten floor," it becomes clear that the path to reform is fraught with challenges, but it is also filled with hope. Judge Leifman’s advocacy shines a light on the possibility of change, urging us to reconsider how we treat the mentally ill within our justice system. It is a call to action for all of us to engage in this critical conversation, to push for policies that prioritize treatment over punishment, and to ensure that no one is left behind in the shadows of our society. The journey toward justice for the mentally ill is just beginning, and it is one that we must all be a part of.

MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Drivers who were on the Minneapolis bridge when it collapsed told harrowing tales of survival. "The whole bridge from one side of the Mississippi to the other just completely gave way, fell all the way down," survivor Gary Babineau told CNN. "I probably had a 30-, 35-foot free fall. And there's cars in the water, there's cars on fire. The whole bridge is down." He said his back was injured but he determined he could move around. "I realized there was a school bus right next to me, and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge. They were yelling, screaming, bleeding. I think there were some broken bones."  Watch a driver describe his narrow escape » . At home when he heard about the disaster, Dr. John Hink, an emergency room physician, jumped into his car and rushed to the scene in 15 minutes. He arrived at the south side of the bridge, stood on the riverbank and saw dozens of people lying dazed on an expansive deck. They were in the middle of the Mississippi River, which was churning fast, and he had no way of getting to them. He went to the north side, where there was easier access to people. Ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene. Working feverishly, volunteers, EMTs and other officials managed to get 55 people into ambulances in less than two hours. Occasionally, a pickup truck with a medic inside would drive to get an injured person and bring him back up even ground, Hink told CNN. The rescue effort was controlled and organized, he said; the opposite of the lightning-quick collapse. "I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling," Babineau said. "It just gave a rumble real quick, and it all just gave way, and it just fell completely, all the way to the ground. And there was dust everywhere and it was just like everyone has been saying: It was just like out of the movies." Babineau said the rear of his pickup truck was dangling over the edge of a broken-off section of the bridge. He said several vehicles slid past him into the water. "I stayed in my car for one or two seconds. I saw a couple cars fall," he said. "So I stayed in my car until the cars quit falling for a second, then I got out real quick, ran in front of my truck -- because behind my truck was just a hole -- and I helped a woman off of the bridge with me. "I just wanted off the bridge, and then I ran over to the school bus. I started grabbing kids and handing them down. It was just complete chaos." He said most of the children were crying or screaming. He and other rescuers set them on the ground and told them to run to the river bank, but a few needed to be carried because of their injuries.  See rescuers clamber over rubble » . Babineau said he had no rescue training. "I just knew what I had to do at the moment." Melissa Hughes, 32, of Minneapolis, told The Associated Press that she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her. "You know that free-fall feeling? I felt that twice," Hughes said. A pickup landed on top of her car, but she was not hurt. "I had no idea there was a vehicle on my car," she told AP. "It's really very surreal." Babineau told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: "On the way down, I thought I was dead. I literally thought I was dead.

Bernie Toivonen told CNN's "American Morning" that his vehicle was on a part of the bridge that ended up tilted at a 45-degree angle. "I knew the deck was going down, there was no question about it, and I thought I was going to die," he said. After the bridge settled and his car remained upright, "I just put in park, turned the key off and said, 'Oh, I'm alive,' " he said. E-mail to a friend .

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Doctors removed five small polyps from President Bush's colon on Saturday, and "none appeared worrisome," a White House spokesman said. The polyps were removed and sent to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for routine microscopic examination, spokesman Scott Stanzel said. Results are expected in two to three days. All were small, less than a centimeter [half an inch] in diameter, he said. Bush is in good humor, Stanzel said, and will resume his activities at Camp David. During the procedure Vice President Dick Cheney assumed presidential power. Bush reclaimed presidential power at 9:21 a.m. after about two hours. Doctors used "monitored anesthesia care," Stanzel said, so the president was asleep, but not as deeply unconscious as with a true general anesthetic. He spoke to first lady Laura Bush -- who is in Midland, Texas, celebrating her mother's birthday -- before and after the procedure, Stanzel said. Afterward, the president played with his Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley, Stanzel said. He planned to have lunch at Camp David and have briefings with National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten, and planned to take a bicycle ride Saturday afternoon.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Doctors removed five small polyps from President Bush's colon on Saturday, and "none appeared worrisome," a White House spokesman said. The polyps were removed and sent to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for routine microscopic examination, spokesman Scott Stanzel said. Results are expected in two to three days. All were small, less than a centimeter [half an inch] in diameter, he said. Bush is in good humor, Stanzel said, and will resume his activities at Camp David. During the procedure Vice President Dick Cheney assumed presidential power. Bush reclaimed presidential power at 9:21 a.m. after about two hours. Doctors used "monitored anesthesia care," Stanzel said, so the president was asleep, but not as deeply unconscious as with a true general anesthetic. He spoke to first lady Laura Bush -- who is in Midland, Texas, celebrating her mother's birthday -- before and after the procedure, Stanzel said. Afterward, the president played with his Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley, Stanzel said. He planned to have lunch at Camp David and have briefings with National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten, and planned to take a bicycle ride Saturday afternoon. Cheney, meanwhile, spent the morning at his home on Maryland's eastern shore, reading and playing with his dogs, Stanzel said.

In a recent medical procedure, President Bush had five small polyps removed from his colon, and thankfully, none of them raised any alarms according to a White House spokesperson. The polyps, all less than half an inch in size, were sent off for a routine microscopic examination at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, with results expected in just a couple of days. Despite the procedure, Bush was reported to be in good spirits and ready to dive back into his activities at Camp David.

During the two-hour procedure, Vice President Dick Cheney temporarily took over presidential duties, but Bush was back in action by 9:21 a.m. The doctors used a method called "monitored anesthesia care," which means the president was asleep but not completely out of it. He even managed to chat with First Lady Laura Bush, who was celebrating her mother's birthday in Texas, before and after the procedure. Afterward, he enjoyed some quality time with his Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley, and had plans for lunch and briefings with key advisors, plus a bike ride later in the day.

Cheney, on the other hand, spent his morning relaxing at home, reading and playing with his own dogs, without any pressing presidential matters to attend to. The procedure was overseen by Dr. Richard Tubb, Bush's personal physician, and a skilled team from the National Naval Medical Center. This wasn’t Bush’s first colonoscopy; his last one was back in June 2002, which came back clear. His doctor had suggested he undergo another one in about five years.

Colonoscopy is a crucial test for detecting colon and rectal cancers, as well as polyps that could potentially turn cancerous. The American Cancer Society recommends that individuals without high-risk factors start getting screened for colorectal cancer at age 50. In a heartfelt message, White House spokesman Tony Snow, who is currently battling his own cancer journey, emphasized the importance of regular screenings, encouraging everyone to stay vigilant about their health.

# Daniel Radcliffe Turns 18: A New Chapter

## Introduction
On his 18th birthday, Daniel Radcliffe, the star of the Harry Potter franchise, gains access to a substantial fortune estimated at £20 million ($41.1 million). Despite this newfound wealth, Radcliffe emphasizes his intention to remain grounded and avoid the pitfalls often associated with young celebrities.

## Financial Prudence
Radcliffe has publicly stated that he does not plan to indulge in extravagant purchases such as luxury cars or lavish parties. Instead, he expresses a preference for modest expenditures, favoring items like books, CDs, and DVDs, which typically cost around £10. This approach reflects a mature attitude towards financial management, especially for someone who has recently come of age.

## Legal Milestones
Turning 18 allows Radcliffe to engage in activities previously restricted to adults, such as gambling in casinos and purchasing alcohol. However, he remains private about his birthday celebrations, indicating that he will have a party but hopes to keep the details out of the media spotlight.

## Career Developments
Radcliffe's earnings from the Harry Potter films have been securely held in a trust fund until his recent birthday. As he transitions into adulthood, he is aware of the increased media scrutiny that comes with it. He has expressed a desire to avoid the common narrative of child stars who struggle with fame, stating, "I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them."

### Upcoming Projects
Beyond the Harry Potter series, Radcliffe is expanding his career with various projects:
- **"My Boy Jack"**: A TV movie about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, set for release later this year.
- **"December Boys"**: An Australian film featuring four boys who escape an orphanage.
- **Stage Debut**: Earlier this year, he made his stage debut in Peter Shaffer's play "Equus," portraying a troubled teenager.

## Conclusion
As Daniel Radcliffe embarks on this new chapter of his life, he remains focused on maintaining a balanced perspective amidst the challenges of fame and fortune. His commitment to financial responsibility and career growth suggests a promising future beyond the Harry Potter legacy.

Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the "forgotten floor," where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the "forgotten floor." Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually "avoidable felonies." He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' » . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. "I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered "lunatics" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the "forgotten floor"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served. E-mail to a friend .

In the heart of Miami, a stark reality unfolds behind the cold, unyielding walls of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility. Here, on the ninth floor, lies what has been hauntingly dubbed the "forgotten floor." This is not just a place of confinement; it is a holding ground for individuals grappling with severe mental illnesses, many of whom find themselves ensnared in a system that offers little in the way of compassion or care. Instead, they are left to languish in a state of distress, awaiting trial for charges that, as Judge Steven Leifman poignantly notes, are often "avoidable felonies."

The grim conditions of this floor are a reflection of a broader societal failure. Inmates, stripped of their dignity, wear sleeveless robes that resemble heavy wool sleeping bags, designed to prevent self-harm. They are devoid of shoes, laces, or even mattresses, confined to tiny, echoing cells that amplify their suffering. The atmosphere is oppressive; the lights glare harshly, and the cacophony of voices—some pleading, others delusional—fills the air. One inmate, convinced of his connection to power, shouts, "I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!" His fervent belief in his own narrative underscores the tragic intersection of mental illness and the criminal justice system.

Judge Leifman, a tireless advocate for the mentally ill, guides us through this harrowing environment. He articulates a profound truth: many of these individuals are not criminals in the traditional sense but rather victims of a system that has failed them at every turn. Confrontations with law enforcement often escalate due to the nature of their illnesses, leading to arrests that could have been avoided with proper mental health interventions. The cycle is vicious; individuals stabilize in mental health facilities only to return to the "forgotten floor," where they receive no real help, perpetuating a cycle of incarceration and untreated illness.

The history of mental health care in America is fraught with neglect and misunderstanding. Judge Leifman recounts a time when individuals labeled as "lunatics" were locked away without charges, deemed unfit for society. While there was a movement to transition these individuals from jails to hospitals, many of those facilities were so inadequate that they were ultimately shut down, leaving countless individuals to fend for themselves on the streets. Today, the number of patients in state mental hospitals has plummeted by 90%, leaving only 40,000 to 50,000 individuals receiving care.

Yet, amidst this bleak landscape, there is a glimmer of hope. Since 2008, a new mental health facility has been established, offering a lifeline to those who would otherwise find themselves on the "forgotten floor." This initiative represents a critical shift towards long-term treatment rather than mere punishment. Judge Leifman emphasizes that this is not a panacea, but it is a significant step in the right direction. It is a win-win solution: patients receive the care they desperately need, families find relief, and the state saves money by breaking the cycle of repeated incarceration.

As we reflect on the stories shared within these walls, it becomes clear that the path to justice is not solely about punishment; it is about understanding, compassion, and the recognition of our shared humanity. The plight of the mentally ill in our jails is a call to action for all of us. We must advocate for systemic change, ensuring that those who suffer from mental illness receive the treatment and support they need, rather than being relegated to the shadows of our justice system. In doing so, we not only serve justice but also honor the dignity of every individual, regardless of their circumstances.

MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Drivers who were on the Minneapolis bridge when it collapsed told harrowing tales of survival. "The whole bridge from one side of the Mississippi to the other just completely gave way, fell all the way down," survivor Gary Babineau told CNN. "I probably had a 30-, 35-foot free fall. And there's cars in the water, there's cars on fire. The whole bridge is down." He said his back was injured but he determined he could move around. "I realized there was a school bus right next to me, and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge. They were yelling, screaming, bleeding. I think there were some broken bones."  Watch a driver describe his narrow escape » . At home when he heard about the disaster, Dr. John Hink, an emergency room physician, jumped into his car and rushed to the scene in 15 minutes. He arrived at the south side of the bridge, stood on the riverbank and saw dozens of people lying dazed on an expansive deck. They were in the middle of the Mississippi River, which was churning fast, and he had no way of getting to them. He went to the north side, where there was easier access to people. Ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene. Working feverishly, volunteers, EMTs and other officials managed to get 55 people into ambulances in less than two hours. Occasionally, a pickup truck with a medic inside would drive to get an injured person and bring him back up even ground, Hink told CNN. The rescue effort was controlled and organized, he said; the opposite of the lightning-quick collapse. "I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling," Babineau said. "It just gave a rumble real quick, and it all just gave way, and it just fell completely, all the way to the ground. And there was dust everywhere and it was just like everyone has been saying: It was just like out of the movies." Babineau said the rear of his pickup truck was dangling over the edge of a broken-off section of the bridge. He said several vehicles slid past him into the water. "I stayed in my car for one or two seconds. I saw a couple cars fall," he said. "So I stayed in my car until the cars quit falling for a second, then I got out real quick, ran in front of my truck -- because behind my truck was just a hole -- and I helped a woman off of the bridge with me. "I just wanted off the bridge, and then I ran over to the school bus. I started grabbing kids and handing them down. It was just complete chaos." He said most of the children were crying or screaming. He and other rescuers set them on the ground and told them to run to the river bank, but a few needed to be carried because of their injuries.  See rescuers clamber over rubble » . Babineau said he had no rescue training. "I just knew what I had to do at the moment." Melissa Hughes, 32, of Minneapolis, told The Associated Press that she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her. "You know that free-fall feeling? I felt that twice," Hughes said. A pickup landed on top of her car, but she was not hurt. "I had no idea there was a vehicle on my car," she told AP. "It's really very surreal." Babineau told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: "On the way down, I thought I was dead. I literally thought I was dead. "My truck was completely face down, pointed toward the ground, and my truck got ripped in half. It was folded in half, and I can't believe I'm alive."  See and hear eyewitness accounts » . Bernie Toivonen told CNN's "American Morning" that his vehicle was on a part of the bridge that ended up tilted at a 45-degree angle. "I knew the deck was going down, there was no question about it, and I thought I was going to die," he said. After the bridge settled and his car remained upright, "I just put in park, turned the key off and said, 'Oh, I'm alive,' " he said. E-mail to a friend .

"It just gave a rumble real quick, and it all just gave way, and it just fell completely, all the way to the ground. And there was dust everywhere and it was just like everyone has been saying: It was just like out of the movies." Babineau said the rear of his pickup truck was dangling over the edge of a broken-off section of the bridge. He said several vehicles slid past him into the water. "I stayed in my car for one or two seconds. I saw a couple cars fall," he said. "So I stayed in my car until the cars quit falling for a second, then I got out real quick, ran in front of my truck -- because behind my truck was just a hole -- and I helped a woman off of the bridge with me. "I just wanted off the bridge, and then I ran over to the school bus. I started grabbing kids and handing them down. It was just complete chaos." He said most of the children were crying or screaming. He and other rescuers set them on the ground and told them to run to the river bank, but a few needed to be carried because of their injuries.  See rescuers clamber over rubble » . Babineau said he had no rescue training. "I just knew what I had to do at the moment." Melissa Hughes, 32, of Minneapolis, told The Associated Press that she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her. "You know that free-fall feeling? I felt that twice," Hughes said. A pickup landed on top of her car, but she was not hurt. "I had no idea there was a vehicle on my car," she told AP. "It's really very surreal." Babineau told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: "On the way down, I thought I was dead. I literally thought I was dead. "My truck was completely face down, pointed toward the ground, and my truck got ripped in half. It was folded in half, and I can't believe I'm alive."  See and hear eyewitness accounts » . Bernie Toivonen told CNN's "American Morning" that his vehicle was on a part of the bridge that ended up tilted at a 45-degree angle. "I knew the deck was going down, there was no question about it, and I thought I was going to die," he said. After the bridge settled and his car remained upright, "I just put in park, turned the key off and said, 'Oh, I'm alive,' " he said. E-mail to a friend .

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Doctors removed five small polyps from President Bush's colon on Saturday, and "none appeared worrisome," a White House spokesman said. The polyps were removed and sent to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for routine microscopic examination, spokesman Scott Stanzel said. Results are expected in two to three days. All were small, less than a centimeter [half an inch] in diameter, he said. Bush is in good humor, Stanzel said, and will resume his activities at Camp David. During the procedure Vice President Dick Cheney assumed presidential power. Bush reclaimed presidential power at 9:21 a.m. after about two hours. Doctors used "monitored anesthesia care," Stanzel said, so the president was asleep, but not as deeply unconscious as with a true general anesthetic. He spoke to first lady Laura Bush -- who is in Midland, Texas, celebrating her mother's birthday -- before and after the procedure, Stanzel said. Afterward, the president played with his Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley, Stanzel said. He planned to have lunch at Camp David and have briefings with National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten, and planned to take a bicycle ride Saturday afternoon. Cheney, meanwhile, spent the morning at his home on Maryland's eastern shore, reading and playing with his dogs, Stanzel said. Nothing occurred that required him to take official action as president before Bush reclaimed presidential power. The procedure was supervised by Dr. Richard Tubb, Bush's physician, and conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, the White House said. Bush's last colonoscopy was in June 2002, and no abnormalities were found, White House spokesman Tony Snow said. The president's doctor had recommended a repeat procedure in about five years. A colonoscopy is the most sensitive test for colon cancer, rectal cancer and polyps, small clumps of cells that can become cancerous, according to the Mayo Clinic. Small polyps may be removed during the procedure. Snow said on Friday that Bush had polyps removed during colonoscopies before becoming president. Snow himself is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer that began in his colon and spread to his liver.  Watch Snow talk about Bush's procedure and his own colon cancer » . "The president wants to encourage everybody to use surveillance," Snow said. The American Cancer Society recommends that people without high risk factors or symptoms begin getting screened for signs of colorectal cancer at age 50. E-mail to a friend .

In a recent health update, President Bush underwent a routine colonoscopy where doctors successfully removed five small polyps. Thankfully, none of these polyps raised any alarms, according to White House spokesman Scott Stanzel. The polyps were sent off for a standard microscopic examination at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, with results expected in just a couple of days. All the polyps were quite small, measuring less than a centimeter, so there’s no cause for concern.

After the procedure, which involved a light form of anesthesia, Bush was in good spirits and ready to get back to his usual activities at Camp David. Interestingly, during the two hours he was under, Vice President Dick Cheney temporarily took over presidential duties. But by 9:21 a.m., Bush was back in action, chatting with First Lady Laura Bush, who was celebrating her mother’s birthday in Texas. 

Post-procedure, the president enjoyed some quality time with his Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley, and had plans for lunch and briefings with key advisors. Meanwhile, Cheney was enjoying a quiet morning at home, reading and playing with his own dogs, with no pressing matters requiring his attention.

This wasn’t Bush’s first colonoscopy; his last one was back in June 2002, which also came back clear. His doctor had suggested he repeat the procedure every five years, and it’s a good reminder of the importance of regular screenings. The Mayo Clinic emphasizes that colonoscopies are crucial for detecting potential issues like colon cancer and polyps, which can be precursors to cancer. 

Tony Snow, the White House spokesman, who is currently undergoing chemotherapy for colon cancer, echoed the president's message about the importance of surveillance and screenings. The American Cancer Society recommends that individuals without high-risk factors start getting screened for colorectal cancer at age 50. So, if you’re approaching that age, or even if you’re not, it’s a good time to think about your health and get checked!

This approach reflects a mature attitude towards financial management, especially for someone who has been in the public eye since childhood.

## Conclusion
Daniel Radcliffe's 18th birthday marks not only a significant financial milestone but also a pivotal moment in his personal and professional life. His focus on prudence, diverse career choices, and awareness of media scrutiny positions him as a thoughtful and grounded individual in the entertainment industry.

Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the "forgotten floor," where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the "forgotten floor." Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually "avoidable felonies." He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' » . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. "I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered "lunatics" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the "forgotten floor"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served. E-mail to a friend .

Response:
In the heart of Miami, a stark reality unfolds on the ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility, a place ominously referred to as the "forgotten floor." This is where some of the most vulnerable members of society—individuals grappling with severe mental illnesses—are confined, often awaiting trial for charges that, as Judge Steven Leifman points out, are frequently "avoidable felonies." These charges typically stem from confrontations with law enforcement, where the mentally ill, overwhelmed by their conditions, struggle to comply with police directives, leading to escalated situations that result in arrest.

As we step into this grim environment, guided by Judge Leifman, a passionate advocate for mental health reform, the conditions are immediately striking. The inmates, clad in sleeveless robes designed to prevent self-harm, appear almost ghost-like, their humanity obscured by the harsh realities of their confinement. The absence of shoes, laces, and even mattresses speaks volumes about the system's approach to managing mental illness—an approach that prioritizes containment over care.

Leifman reveals a staggering statistic: approximately one-third of the inmates in Miami-Dade County jails are mentally ill. This overwhelming number has created a crisis within the system, where the ninth floor serves as a holding pen rather than a place of healing. The environment is anything but conducive to recovery; the glaring lights, cramped cells, and cacophony of sounds contribute to an atmosphere of despair. In this setting, we witness the tragic consequences of neglect—men shouting delusions, convinced of their own importance, lost in a world that has failed to provide them with the help they desperately need.

The cycle of incarceration and inadequate treatment is a brutal reality for these individuals. Leifman explains that many of these inmates oscillate between jail and mental hospitals, receiving temporary stabilization only to return to the very environment that exacerbates their conditions. This cycle is not just a personal tragedy; it is a systemic failure that demands urgent attention and reform.

Reflecting on the historical context, Leifman recounts a time when individuals labeled as "lunatics" were locked away without charges, deemed unfit for society. While there was a movement to transition these individuals from jails to hospitals, the closure of many mental health facilities due to inhumane conditions left countless patients without care, leading to a rise in homelessness and untreated mental illness.

However, there is a glimmer of hope. Since 2008, efforts have been made to redirect inmates who would typically end up on the "forgotten floor" to a new mental health facility. This initiative represents a crucial step toward long-term treatment rather than mere punishment. Leifman emphasizes that this approach is not a panacea, but it is a significant move in the right direction—a win-win solution that benefits patients, eases the burden on families, and ultimately saves the state money by breaking the cycle of recidivism.

In advocating for change, Leifman embodies the belief that justice should extend beyond the courtroom. It should encompass compassion, understanding, and a commitment to addressing the root causes of mental illness. As we leave the "forgotten floor," it is clear that the journey toward reform is just beginning, but with advocates like Leifman leading the charge, there is hope for a future where mental health is treated with the dignity and respect it deserves. 

This narrative serves as a call to action for all of us. We must recognize the humanity in those who suffer from mental illness and advocate for systems that prioritize treatment over punishment. By doing so, we can help create a society that not only seeks justice but also fosters healing and understanding for its most vulnerable members.

LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him.

Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the "forgotten floor," where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the "forgotten floor." Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually "avoidable felonies." He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' » . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. "I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered "lunatics" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the "forgotten floor"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served. E-mail to a friend .

In the heart of Miami, a stark reality unfolds on the ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility, a place ominously referred to as the "forgotten floor." This is where some of the most vulnerable members of our society—individuals grappling with severe mental illnesses—are confined, often awaiting trial for charges that could have been avoided with proper care and intervention. Judge Steven Leifman, a passionate advocate for mental health reform, sheds light on the grim circumstances that lead to these individuals being incarcerated rather than receiving the treatment they desperately need.

The conditions on the ninth floor are harrowing. Inmates, stripped of their dignity, wear sleeveless robes designed to prevent self-harm, and the environment is anything but conducive to healing. The stark reality is that one-third of the inmates in Miami-Dade County jails are mentally ill, a statistic that overwhelms the system and highlights a critical failure in our approach to mental health care. The loud, glaring lights and cramped cells create an atmosphere of despair, where individuals often find themselves trapped in a cycle of incarceration and instability.

As we accompany Judge Leifman on a tour of this facility, the stories of the inmates resonate deeply. One man, convinced he is the son of the president, shouts for help, embodying the tragic disconnect between his reality and the world outside. These individuals are not criminals in the traditional sense; they are victims of a system that has failed to provide them with the necessary support and treatment. Instead of receiving care, they are subjected to punitive measures that exacerbate their conditions.

Historically, the treatment of the mentally ill has been fraught with challenges. Two centuries ago, individuals deemed "lunatics" were often locked away without charges, simply because they were considered unfit for society. While there was a movement to transition these individuals from jails to hospitals, many of those facilities were so inadequate that they were ultimately shut down, leaving countless patients to fend for themselves on the streets. This tragic history has led us to the current crisis, where the number of individuals in state mental hospitals has plummeted by 90% since 1955, leaving only 40,000 to 50,000 people receiving care.

Judge Leifman is determined to change this narrative. Since 2008, he has championed the establishment of a new mental health facility aimed at providing long-term treatment for inmates who would otherwise find themselves on the forgotten floor. This initiative represents a crucial step toward addressing the root causes of mental illness and breaking the cycle of incarceration. It is a win-win solution: patients receive the care they need, families find relief, and the state saves money by reducing the frequency of repeat incarcerations.

The journey toward reform is not without its challenges, but the commitment to justice and compassion is evident in Judge Leifman's advocacy. By prioritizing mental health care over punishment, we can begin to dismantle the barriers that have long kept the mentally ill trapped in a cycle of despair. It is time to recognize that these individuals deserve our empathy and support, not our scorn. The forgotten floor should not be a place of confinement but a catalyst for change, paving the way for a more just and humane approach to mental health care in our society. 

As we reflect on the stories from the ninth floor, let us advocate for a system that prioritizes treatment over punishment, ensuring that those who suffer from mental illness receive the help they need to reclaim their lives. Together, we can work toward a future where justice is truly served, and the forgotten are no longer left behind.

**Birthday Plans**

On his special day, Daniel can do fun things like go to a casino or watch scary movies. He promised to have a party, but he wants it to be a secret. Shhh!

Now that he’s an adult, Daniel knows people will be watching him closely. But he’s determined to stay true to himself. He wants to show everyone that he can be a good role model.

**Daniel Radcliffe Turns 18!**

Once upon a time in London, a young wizard named Daniel Radcliffe was about to celebrate a very special birthday. He was turning 18! That meant he could do lots of grown-up things, like go to a casino or buy a drink at a pub. But guess what? Daniel had a magical surprise—he had a treasure of £20 million! That's a lot of money!

**Staying Grounded**

But Daniel wasn't going to let the money change him. He said, "I won’t buy fast cars or go to wild parties." Instead, he loves to buy books and music, things that cost just a little bit. He wants to keep his feet on the ground and not become a wild star. 

**Birthday Plans**

Daniel was excited about his birthday party but kept his plans a secret. He said, "Hopefully, none of you will be reading about it!" He wanted to celebrate with friends and have fun.

**More Adventures Ahead**

Even though he was famous for being Harry Potter, Daniel had more adventures waiting for him. He filmed a movie called "My Boy Jack" and was in a play called "Equus." He was ready for new stories and new roles!

**Growing Up**

Now that he was 18, Daniel knew the world would be watching him closely. But he was ready to face it all with a smile. He was still the same kind-hearted boy, just a little older and a lot wiser!

And so, Daniel Radcliffe continued his journey, proving that even with a treasure, it's important to stay true to yourself. The end!

Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the "forgotten floor," where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the "forgotten floor." Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually "avoidable felonies." He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' » . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. "I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered "lunatics" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the "forgotten floor"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served. E-mail to a friend .

Once upon a time, in a big city called Miami, there was a special place known as the "forgotten floor." This was a part of a jail where people who were very sad and confused lived. They were not bad people; they just needed help because they were mentally ill.

Judge Steven Leifman, a kind man who cares a lot about these people, took us on a tour of this floor. He told us that many of the people there got into trouble because they didn’t understand what was happening around them. When police came, they got scared and confused, which made things worse. Instead of getting help, they ended up in jail!

The people on the forgotten floor wore funny robes that looked like sleeping bags with holes for their arms and feet. They didn’t have shoes or comfy beds because the jail wanted to keep them safe. But it was loud and bright, and the tiny cells didn’t feel nice at all.

One man shouted, “I am the son of the president!” He really believed someone would come to help him. Judge Leifman explained that many of these people would go to a hospital to feel better, but then they would come back to jail again. This made him very sad because he wanted to change things.

Long ago, people who were mentally ill were treated very badly. They were locked up even if they hadn’t done anything wrong! But then, people started to care and wanted to help them. Sadly, many hospitals were not nice, so they closed down, and the people ended up on the streets without help.

Judge Leifman is working hard to make things better. Since 2008, some of the people who would go to the forgotten floor now go to a new place where they can get the help they need. This is a good start! It helps the people feel better, makes their families happy, and even saves money for the state.

In the end, everyone wins when we help those who need it most! And that’s what Judge Leifman believes is true justice.

MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Drivers who were on the Minneapolis bridge when it collapsed told harrowing tales of survival. "The whole bridge from one side of the Mississippi to the other just completely gave way, fell all the way down," survivor Gary Babineau told CNN. "I probably had a 30-, 35-foot free fall. And there's cars in the water, there's cars on fire. The whole bridge is down." He said his back was injured but he determined he could move around. "I realized there was a school bus right next to me, and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge. They were yelling, screaming, bleeding. I think there were some broken bones."  Watch a driver describe his narrow escape » . At home when he heard about the disaster, Dr. John Hink, an emergency room physician, jumped into his car and rushed to the scene in 15 minutes. He arrived at the south side of the bridge, stood on the riverbank and saw dozens of people lying dazed on an expansive deck. They were in the middle of the Mississippi River, which was churning fast, and he had no way of getting to them. He went to the north side, where there was easier access to people. Ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene. Working feverishly, volunteers, EMTs and other officials managed to get 55 people into ambulances in less than two hours. Occasionally, a pickup truck with a medic inside would drive to get an injured person and bring him back up even ground, Hink told CNN. The rescue effort was controlled and organized, he said; the opposite of the lightning-quick collapse. "I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling," Babineau said. "It just gave a rumble real quick, and it all just gave way, and it just fell completely, all the way to the ground. And there was dust everywhere and it was just like everyone has been saying: It was just like out of the movies." Babineau said the rear of his pickup truck was dangling over the edge of a broken-off section of the bridge. He said several vehicles slid past him into the water. "I stayed in my car for one or two seconds. I saw a couple cars fall," he said. "So I stayed in my car until the cars quit falling for a second, then I got out real quick, ran in front of my truck -- because behind my truck was just a hole -- and I helped a woman off of the bridge with me. "I just wanted off the bridge, and then I ran over to the school bus. I started grabbing kids and handing them down. It was just complete chaos." He said most of the children were crying or screaming. He and other rescuers set them on the ground and told them to run to the river bank, but a few needed to be carried because of their injuries.  See rescuers clamber over rubble » . Babineau said he had no rescue training. "I just knew what I had to do at the moment." Melissa Hughes, 32, of Minneapolis, told The Associated Press that she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her. "You know that free-fall feeling? I felt that twice," Hughes said. A pickup landed on top of her car, but she was not hurt. "I had no idea there was a vehicle on my car," she told AP. "It's really very surreal." Babineau told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: "On the way down, I thought I was dead. I literally thought I was dead. "My truck was completely face down, pointed toward the ground, and my truck got ripped in half. It was folded in half, and I can't believe I'm alive."  See and hear eyewitness accounts » . Bernie Toivonen told CNN's "American Morning" that his vehicle was on a part of the bridge that ended up tilted at a 45-degree angle. "I knew the deck was going down, there was no question about it, and I thought I was going to die," he said. After the bridge settled and his car remained upright, "I just put in park, turned the key off and said, 'Oh, I'm alive,' " he said. E-mail to a friend .

Once upon a time in Minneapolis, a big bridge over the Mississippi River suddenly fell down! Oh no! Many drivers were on the bridge when it happened, and they had some scary stories to tell.

- **Gary Babineau** was one of the drivers. He felt like he was falling from a really high place! He saw cars in the water and even some on fire. But Gary was brave! He helped lift kids off a school bus that was nearby. The kids were scared and hurt, but Gary and his friends made sure they got to safety.

- **Dr. John Hink**, a doctor, heard about the bridge falling and rushed to help. He saw many people who needed help but couldn’t get to them right away. So, he worked with other helpers to get 55 people into ambulances quickly. They were all working together like superheroes!

- Gary described the bridge falling like a movie scene. It was loud and dusty, and he thought he might not make it. But he did! He even helped a lady escape from the bridge.

- **Melissa Hughes** was driving home when the bridge collapsed under her. She felt like she was flying! A pickup truck landed on her car, but she was okay. It was all very strange for her.

- **Bernie Toivonen** was also on the bridge. He felt his car tilting and thought he was going to be in big trouble. But when the bridge stopped moving, he was so happy to be alive!

Everyone worked together to help each other, and even though it was a scary day, they showed how brave and kind people can be. The end!

LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. "I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar," he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. "I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. "The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs." At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film "Hostel: Part II," currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. "I'll definitely have some sort of party," he said in an interview. "Hopefully none of you will be reading about it." Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. "People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'" he told reporters last month. "But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them." His latest outing as the boy wizard in "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.  Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest » . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called "My Boy Jack," about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in "December Boys," an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer's "Equus." Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: "I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game," he told Reuters. E-mail to a friend .

**Daniel Radcliffe Turns 18!**

Once upon a time in London, a young wizard named Daniel Radcliffe, who played Harry Potter, was about to celebrate a very special birthday—his 18th! With this big day, he would gain access to a magical fortune of £20 million (that’s about $41.1 million!). But guess what? Daniel promised he wouldn’t let the money change him!

Instead of buying flashy sports cars or partying like a celebrity, Daniel said he prefers to spend his money on things like books, CDs, and DVDs—things that cost around 10 pounds. How cool is that?

As he turns 18, Daniel can now do things like gamble in a casino or buy a drink at a pub. He mentioned he would have a party, but he wanted to keep the details a secret. 

Even with all his fame and fortune, Daniel stays grounded. He knows people often worry about child stars going off track, but he’s determined to stay true to himself. 

Daniel is still busy being the boy wizard in the Harry Potter movies, which are breaking records everywhere! But he’s also exploring new adventures. He’s filmed a TV movie called "My Boy Jack" and will be in a film called "December Boys." Plus, he made his stage debut in a play called "Equus."

Now that he’s an adult, Daniel knows the media will be watching him even more closely. But he’s ready for it! 

Happy Birthday, Daniel! May your journey be filled with magic and wonderful stories!

**Daniel Radcliffe Turns 18!**

Guess what? Daniel Radcliffe, the star of Harry Potter, is turning 18! That means he gets to enjoy a big fortune of £20 million (that’s about $41.1 million!). But don’t worry, he’s not planning to spend it on flashy cars or wild parties. 

Daniel loves simple things like books, CDs, and DVDs that cost around 10 pounds. He wants to stay grounded and not become a “kid star gone wild.” He’s excited about having a birthday party, but he wants to keep the details a secret!

Even though he’s famous and has lots of money, Daniel is focused on his acting career. He’s been busy with new movies and even made his stage debut in a play called "Equus." 

Now that he’s an adult, he knows the media will be watching him more closely. But Daniel is ready to handle it! Happy birthday, Daniel! 🎉

Once upon a time, in a big city called Miami, there was a special place known as the "forgotten floor." This was a part of a jail where people who were feeling very sad and confused lived. Many of them had mental illnesses, which made it hard for them to understand what was happening around them. They often got into trouble with the police, not because they were bad, but because they didn’t know how to follow instructions when they were scared.

A kind judge named Steven Leifman wanted to help these people. He noticed that many of them were stuck in jail, wearing funny robes that looked like sleeping bags with holes for their arms and feet. They didn’t have shoes or comfy beds because the jail wanted to keep them safe from hurting themselves. But Judge Leifman thought this was not fair. He believed that these people needed help, not just punishment.

He shared a story about how, a long time ago, people with mental illnesses were treated very badly. They were locked away, even if they hadn’t done anything wrong. Over time, some people realized this was wrong, and they tried to help. But many hospitals that were supposed to care for them were not nice places, so they closed down. Sadly, many of these people ended up living on the streets without any help.

Judge Leifman wanted to change this story. He started a new plan in 2008, where instead of going to the "forgotten floor," many of these people would go to a special place where they could get the help they needed. This was the first step towards making their lives better. He believed that when these people got the right care, everyone would be happier – the patients, their families, and even the city would save money!

So, Judge Leifman worked hard to make sure that justice was served, not just by punishing people, but by helping them heal. And that, dear friends, is how a little kindness and understanding can change the world for the better!
